                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I'm looking for a role as a web developer. After 12 years in educational publishing and 8 years teaching, 
                    I decided that it was time for a new challenge. I was self-employed as a Learning Designer, Product Manager, 
                    Writer and Editor until recently, when I stopped working to focus on my career transition full time. Having 
                    dabbled with computer science since university and throughout my career, I felt that web development was the 
                    right direction to take. Initially, I completed a crash course with Zero to Mastery and am now studying full 
                    stack web development in JavaScript with The Odin Project.</p>

                    <h2>Battleship</h2>
                    <p>A game of Battleship where you play against the computer. I used TDD (Test Driven Development) to create the 
                        game in JavaScript. The player needs to drag and drop their ships on to their gameboard and the computer has 
                        a higher IQ than average. Can you beat the computer?</p>

                    <h2>Weather app</h2>
                    <p>An app to give you the weather forecast anywhere in the world. I used JavaScript promises with async and await. 
                        The weather forecast includes options for hourly, 7 days and 15 days. It also has the humidity level - whch I 
                        find super useful living in the Pays Basque!

                    <h2>Task list</h2>
                    <p>A task list with options for multiple project lists. I used SOLID principles to organise the project and 
                        webpack to bundle the files. Tasks can include a title, description, notes, date, time and priority. Projects 
                        can be set to different color schemes and tasks moved between them.</p>

                    <h2>Library</h2>
                    <p>A book shelf with key information about different books. I used various JavaScript functions and classes. Books 
                        can be added through a form, and must include a title, author, genre, page count, and whether the book's been 
                        read. Do you have a book to add?</p>

                    <h2>Admin dashboard</h2>
                    <p>A full dashboard design using CSS Grid. I used Emmet to write HTML and CSS - it was so quick and easy! I included 
                        a wide variety of CSS properties, functions, selectors and pseudo-classes to ensure the best possible design. 
                        Which story would you like to read?</p>

                    <h2>Calculator</h2>
                    <p>A calculator to work out how valuable I could be for your company. I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create, 
                        design and ensure the functionality of the calculator. You can use floating point numbers, undo your last input 
                        and choose between using a keyboard or mouse.</p>
